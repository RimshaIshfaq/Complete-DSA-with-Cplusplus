// two's complement
// it is sum of one's complement with 1



// to store negative number, we need to calculate its two's complement
// to calculate two's complement:
// 1. calculate binary form 
// 2. prefix binary form with a zero which is most significant bit (MSB)
// if MSB=0, number is positive
// if MSB=1, number is negative 
// 3. get one's complement (invert all bits)
// 4. Add 1 to the one's complement to get two's complement
